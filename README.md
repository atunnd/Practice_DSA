My Practice in DSA

According to Jovian, why should I learn DSA:
- You can think about a problem systematically and solve it systematically step-by-step
- You can envision different inputs, outputs, and edge cases for programs you write
- You can communicate your ideas clearly to co-workes and incorporate their suggestions.
- You can convert your thoughts and ideas into working code that's also readable.
